Dear Telegram,

It's my pleasure if you can see this message.
I've been attempting to use PyTorch's Transformer for this competition.
As I found the competition, there's less than 24 hours left until it ends.
It took some effort to compile the well-trained PyTorch model for use in C.
I hope you enjoy my code.

Best,
Youran
